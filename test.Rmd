## Presentation Overview

- The goal of this project was to demonstrate the inclusion of a Plotly chart within a web based presentation
- This presentation was developed using RStudio Markdown generating an ioslides presentation output
- The data was taken from the MT Cars dataset included with ggplot2
- The question we are addressing is the relationship between engine horsepower and engine displacement after controlling for the number of cylinders in the engine
- The final plot was generated using ggplot and then rendered as a Plotly chart using the ggplotly function


## Final Plotly Chart
<small>You can access Plotly's interactive options if you hover over the chart title</small>
```{r main, echo = FALSE, plotly = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

df <- mtcars
df$cyl <- as.factor(df$cyl)

g <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = disp, y = hp, color = cyl)) +
     geom_point(size = 3) +
     geom_smooth() + 
     geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
     labs(title = "Gross Horsepower vs. Engine Displacement", subtitle = "By Number of Cylinders") +
     labs(x = "Engine Displacement (cubic inches)", y = "Gross Horsepower") +
     theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, color = "blue", hjust = 0.5)) + 
     theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, color = "black", hjust = 0.5))

p_plotly <- ggplotly(g)
